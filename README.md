# compass_rose
This project uses an ESP32 to read joystick inputs and determine direction based on X and Y values, displaying compass directions. It demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by encapsulating joystick functionality in a class that reads values and prints the direction to the Serial Monitor.
